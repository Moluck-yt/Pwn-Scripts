# Pwn-Scripts: My Personal Security Toolkit

A personal collection of security scripts, exploits, and utilities developed for educational purposes, penetration testing labs, and CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges. This repository serves as my personal arsenal of tools created and maintained during my cybersecurity studies.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All tools and scripts in this repository are intended for use in **authorized, controlled, and ethical environments only** (such as personal labs, CTF platforms, and bug bounty programs where explicit permission is granted).

Unauthorized use of these tools against systems you do not own or have permission to test is illegal. I am not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by these scripts.

## Repository Structure

Each tool or exploit is contained within its own directory. Inside each directory, you will typically find the script itself and a dedicated `README.md` file explaining the specific vulnerability, the script's usage, and how to mitigate the flaw.

## Available Tools

Here is a list of the tools currently available in this toolkit:
